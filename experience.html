              Coding Instructor: 2018 - 2020 <br>
              I taught kids the basics of coding while under this company.<br>
              I used a variety of languages as simple as Scratch MIT, to Python, to Java and Javascript. <br>
              The job also included responsibilities like taking care of computer equipment,<br> making sure they were updated, and keeping
              all programs up to date.<br>

              Tutor: 2016 - 2021 <br>
              In high school and into college I tutored kids in grades 1 - 12. <br>
              The subjects I taught were mainly math and science, ranging from simple arithmetic to calculus, and <br>
              simple physical science to chemistry.
              There were also times where I taught coding in HTML and javascript to kids in summer sessions.

          <h2 id="job3"> <u>Independent </u> </h2>
            <p id="desc3">
              I've made a couple of personal projects here and there. <br>
              There's this portfolio website that I've buit, <br>
              and I've also helped make some network applications for a professor outside of class work. <br>

          <h2 id="volunteer"> <u>Church of Christ </u></h2>
            <p id= "desc4">
              I volunteer at a church every Saturday. I have a role there as tech support. <br>
              I set up equipment as technology is more involved during quarantine, and I'm there to diagnose and fix any problems with the equipment <br>
              I also have a role as a youth group president, both in leading children and young adults alike. <br>
              This includes having activities such as meetings, meet ups, and organizing events
            </p>
          <h2 id="skills"> <u>Skills </u></h2>
            <p id ="desc5">
              I have experience with the following coding languages: <br>
              Java, JavaScript, Python, C/C++, and HTML&CSS <br>
              I am mainly proficient in front end programming, so Javascript and HTML&CSS are my most well known languages.
